# Git Hub Basics

## Introduction

In this very short project, you will demonstrate your knowledge of the various and sundry
Git Hub commands to build a short demonstration project showing the proper workflow techniques.

## Project Requirements

Your project should include each of the following components:

- At least 10 commits (at least 5 from each group member)
- As many good commit messages as commits
- A main branch and at least two other branches
- At least one merge with a merge conflict and resolution

For an extra point do either or both of the following

- Create a pull request on Git Hub before merging
- Cherry pick a commit from another branch (you'll have to look this one up)
